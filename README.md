for Eb clarinet, Bass clarinet and electronics

This repository contains sound files and a QLab file necessary to perform the piece. 
For reference, the SuperCollider script and sound files '1_mono' and '8_mono' that are used to create performance sound files are also included. Files 1_mono and 8_mono are the mono mix of the 1st and the 8th sound file generated from the script.

When setting up the electronics, make sure that the directory in QLab is modified to the downloaded files.
