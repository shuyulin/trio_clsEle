for Eb clarinet, Bass clarinet and electronics

This repository contains sound files and a QLab file necessary to perform the piece. 
For reference, the SuperCollider script and a pre-recorded clarinet sound (named 'multi1') that are used to create performance sound files are also included.

When setting up the electronics, make sure that the directory in QLab is modified to the downloaded files.
